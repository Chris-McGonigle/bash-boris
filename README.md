## Site Design Considerations

### Site Goals

1. To provide a fun game to play that requires little instruction.
2. To provide a game that is responsive across all devices.
3. To provide a game that entices the user to return to play again.
4. To provide differing game modes dependant on user preference.
5. To record scores of each game to enable user to return to beat score
6. To ensure the game is fully accessible to those users that may require assisstive technologies.

### User Stories and Goals

* As user, I want to be able to view the website on any of my devices without any loss of functionality.
* As a user, I want to be able to easily understand the game instructions.
* As a user, I want to be able to see my score easily.
* As a user, I want to be able to keep track of my time remaining easily.
* As a user, I want to be able to play different game modes.
* As a user, I want to be able to record my scores.
* As a user, I want to be able to toggle the volume on and off.

### Site Design Approach

The brief for this project was to create an interactive front-end site that should respond to a user’s actions. To this end, it was decided to create a Whack A Mole style game. Early on in the design process it was decided to create a themed game.

Simple javascript games are ubiquitous online, and if thinking commercially, to drive traffic and advertising revenue to a site above others offering a similar experience, a developer needs to appreciate the zeitgeist at the time, and offer something current and in the public’s mind.

There can be no bigger current affair in the UK at the moment than Brexit, and framing a game around a ‘popular’ subject can tap into general discourse at the time. 

It was for this reason that a theme involving the UK Prime Minister and the Northern Ireland Protocol was chosen. It is current, with high public visibility, and if presenting commercially taps into public conversation at the time....and also...who wouldn;t love to give their own politicians a virtual bashing!!
