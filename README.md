## Site Design Considerations

### Site Goals

1. To provide a fun game to play that requires little instruction.
2. To provide a game that is responsive across all devices.
3. To provide a game that entices the user to return to play again.
4. To provide differing game modes dependant on user preference.
5. To record scores of each game to enable user to return to beat score
6. To ensure the game is fully accessible to those users that may require assisstive technologies.

### User Stories and Goals

* As a user, I want to easily ascertain the purpose of the website.
* As user, I want to be able to view the website on any of my devices without any loss of functionality.
* As a user, I want to be able to easily understand the game instructions.
* As a user, I want to be able to see my score easily.
* As a user, I want to be able to keep track of my time remaining easily.
* As a user, I want to be able to play different game modes.
* As a user, I want to be able to record my scores.
* As a user, I want to be able to toggle the volume on and off.

### Site Design Approach

The brief for this project was to create an interactive front-end site that should respond to a user’s actions. To this end, it was decided to create a Whack A Mole style game. Early on in the design process it was decided to create a themed game.

Simple javascript games are ubiquitous online, and if thinking commercially, to drive traffic and advertising revenue to a site above others offering a similar experience, a developer needs to appreciate the zeitgeist at the time, and offer something current and in the public’s mind.

There can be no bigger current affair in the UK at the moment than Brexit, and framing a game around a ‘popular’ subject can tap into general discourse at the time. 

It was for this reason that a theme involving the UK Prime Minister and the Northern Ireland Protocol was chosen. It is current, with high public visibility, and if presenting commercially taps into public conversation at the time....and also...who wouldn't love to give their own politicians a virtual bashing!!

### Game Visual Design and Font

In keeping with the game theme, it was decided that the main backdrop for the game should be a image of 10 Downing Street. This served two purposes, firstly as discussed it ties in with the theme that the game is carrying, and second, the path area of Downing Street would be perfect to contain mole holes.

Again instead of using standard holes, as the main game area was to be a street, it was decided to use man hole covers to maintain the game theme.

The colours used reflect the colours used in the background, namely blues, reds and whites. This was specifcially chosen to mirror the colours of the UK national flag, again to keep the theme consistent throughout. Fredoka and Raleway were intially chosen as site fonts, with Raleway being the predominant font used. These fonts are modern, legible and make it easy for the user to understand any text areas in the site. 

For the moles, again on theme, a picture of the Prime ministers head was used. To ensure the game remained fun and light hearted, and so as to not be accused of bullying or bad taste, the decision was taken to cartoonise all of the image elements. 

In doing this, it enforces that the game is meant to be fun, humorours and satirical, and is in no way intended to demonise the main character (the PM).

Finally, it was chosen to force the user to play the game horizontally. this was chosen to try and ensure that mobile users can use the same background as desktop users, so again to maintain the theme that the game is trying to portray.
